# CRUD-Application
## This project is made as submission for Intellij Coding Hackathon.

### Problem Statement: Spring Boot SPA with IJ
Create a single CRUD SPA (Single Page Application) with a RESTful backend. 
The only functionality the app should feature is the maintenance of a single list of first and last names and corresponding phone numbers. 
We should be able to view, add, edit and delete the names and phone numbers.
